                <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                <p>Learning how to design allows you to bring out your personality on your own website, enables you to stand out from the crowd, contribute to projects better, helps you understand and explore other languages and provides you with an opportunity to transition into a different career. That is why i love HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>I've known how to code with HTML 5 and CSS 3 for a while now. Since those aren't real programming languages (they're scripting languages), I decided to start "programming". I say programming in quotes, because JavaScript isn't really programming. It's still more of a scripting language (hence the name JavaScript), but it's a great language for beginners!</p>

                <h3>PHP & MySQL</h3>
                <p>PHP is my favorite programming language. There are a lot of reasons to know and love PHP, probably the most potent and valid of which is this: it’s used and runs everywhere the web does. And because it runs everywhere, and is easy to get started with, a lot of very popular software is written in PHP. When you add MySQL with all of this, my favorite combination. </p>

            <p>Hey, i am Andrej Knezevic, young Web Developer from Belgrade. A year ago I started learning to code, focusing on front-end and back-end development. As you can assume, I had the first encounter with programming at ITAcademy. I have done multiple web projects by myself and realized that I am really passionate about programming. I am 100% sure that I want to build a successful career in IT, because it is fulfilling, and it makes me happy. <br> <br> I enjoy being challenged with IT projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me. I am a friendly, communicative and open-minded person with a strong willingness to learn. I prefer working independently in order to meet deadlines, but take pleasure in collaborating in a group to spark fresh new ideas. <br><br> I have all of the skills and experience that you’re looking for and strong determination to go the extra mile to get the job done correctly. I’m quick learner and good team player, driven to deliver high-quality software solutions.I am aware that I have no experience. But I am willing to learn, motivated to work hard, and I will do my best every day to help you to achieve your goals. If you want to make the technical impacts, be free to contact me.</p>
